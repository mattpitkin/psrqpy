# PSRQpy

This module aims to provide a python interface for querying the [ATNF pulsar catalogue](http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/pulsar/psrcat/). It is an unofficial
package and is not endorsed by or affiliated with the ATNF.

Full documentation of the module can be found [here](http://psrqpy.readthedocs.io/).

Any comments or suggestions are welcome.

## Installation

To install the code from source, clone the git repository and run either:

```
python setup.py install --user
```

to install as a user, or

```
sudo python setup.py install
```

to install as root.

The module can also be installed using `pip` with:

```
pip install psrqpy
```

or in a [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment using:

```
conda install -c conda-forge psrqpy
```

### Requirements

The [requirements](requirements.txt) for installing the code are:

 * [`requests`](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)
 * [`beautifulsoup4`](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
 * [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/)
 * [`scipy`](https://www.scipy.org/)
 * [`astropy`](http://www.astropy.org/)
 * [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
 * [`ads`](https://ads.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
 * [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/)

## Examples

A simple query of the catalogue to, e.g., just return all pulsar frequencies, would be:

```python
import psrqpy

q = psrqpy.QueryATNF(params='F0')

# get frequencies as an astropy table
t = q.table

print(t['F0'])
```

You can query multiple parameters, e.g.:

```python
import psrqpy

q = psrqpy.QueryATNF(params=['F0', 'F1', 'RAJ', 'DecJ'])

# get values as an astropy table
t = q.table

print(t['F0'])
```

You can query specific pulsars, e.g.:

```
import psrqpy

q = psrqpy.QueryATNF(params=['F0', 'F1', 'RAJ', 'DecJ'], psrs=['J0534+2200', 'J0537-6910'])

# get values as an astropy table
t = q.table

# print the table
print(t)
  JNAME          F0       F0_ERR       F1      F1_ERR     RAJ      RAJ_ERR     DECJ     DECJ_ERR
                 Hz         Hz       1 / s2    1 / s2                                           
---------- ------------- ------- ------------- ------ ------------ ------- ------------ --------
J0534+2200     29.946923   1e-06  -3.77535e-10  2e-15 05:34:31.973   0.005 +22:00:52.06     0.06
J0537-6910 62.0261895958 1.3e-09 -1.992272e-10  4e-17 05:37:47.416    0.11 -69:10:19.88      0.6
```

You can set [conditions](http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/psrcat_help.html?type=normal#condition) for the searches,
e.g.:

```python
import psrqpy
q = psrqpy.QueryATNF(params=['Jname', 'f0'], condition='f0 > 100 && f0 < 200', assoc='GC')
```

where `assoc=GC` looks for all pulsars in globular clusters.

When a query is generated the entire catalogue is downloaded and stored in the `QueryATNF` object as
a pandas [`DataFrame`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html).
The query can therefore be re-used to access data on different parameters, different pulsars, or
using different conditions, without the need to re-download the catalogue. We may originally want
to query pulsar frequencies using only frequencies greater than 10 Hz, with

```python
import psrqpy
q = psrqpy.QueryATNF(params=['F0'], condition='F0 > 10')
freqs = q.table['F0']
```

Using the same `QueryATNF` object we could change to get frequency derivatives for pulsars
with frequencies less than 10 Hz, with

```python
q.condition = 'F0 < 10'
q.query_params = 'F1'

fdot = q.table['F1']
```

In these cases the whole catalogue (with no conditions applied and all available parameters) stored as a pandas [`DataFrame`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html)
is accessible with

```python
catalogue = q.catalogue
```

You can also [generate](http://psrqpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/query.html#psrqpy.search.QueryATNF.ppdot) a
_lovely_ period vs. period derivative plot based on the latest catalogue information, using
just three lines of code, e.g.:

```python
from psrqpy import QueryATNF
query = QueryATNF(params=['P0', 'P1', 'ASSOC', 'BINARY', 'TYPE', 'P1_I'])
query.ppdot(showSNRs=True, showtypes='all')
```

gives

## Development and Support

Code development is done via the package's [GitHib repository](https://github.com/mattpitkin/psrqpy).
Any contributions can be made via a [fork and pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) model
from that repository, and must adhere to the [MIT license](#License). Any problems with the code
or support requests can be submitted via the repository's [Issue tracker](https://github.com/mattpitkin/psrqpy/issues).

## Test suite

There are tests supplied that cover many of the functions within PSRQpy. These can be run from the
base directory of the repository (after installing the [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) and
[`pytest-socket`](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-socket/) modules, e.g., with `pip`) by just calling:

```bash
pytest
```

These tests are not included in the `pip` installed version of the code.
